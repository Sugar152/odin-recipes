<h1>Steps</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Cook the vegetables:</li>
        <p>In a large wok or a large skillet over high heat, heat 1 tablespoon of oil. Add the cabbage, carrots, celery, mushroom, garlic, and ginger, and cook stirring frequently until the vegetables are limp and tender, about 5 minutes.</p>
        
        <p>Depending on the size of your wok or skillet, you may have to do this in two batches.</p> 
    <li>Season the filling:</li>
     <p>Turn off the heat and add the green onions, sesame oil, salt, five spice powder (if using), and white pepper. Toss to combine.</p>
    <li>Drain the filling:</li>
      <p>Place a large colander over a large bowl. Transfer the filling into the colander and allow it to drain and fully cool.</p> 
    <li>Set up a wrapping station:</li>
      <p>Lightly sprinkle flour on a large tray or baking sheet. This will ensure the egg rolls don’t stick to the tray. Fill a small bowl with water for sealing the egg rolls and set it next to the tray.</p> 
    <li>Fill the egg rolls:</li>
       <p>Place one wrapper flat on a cutting board or the kitchen counter with one of the corners towards you, so it looks like a diamond. Keep the remaining wrappers covered with a kitchen towel so that they don’t dry out.</p> 
        
      <p>Place a loosely packed 1/2 cup of filling off-center near the corner closest to you.</p> 
    <li>Roll the egg rolls:</li>
       <p>Fold the corner closest to you over the filling. Fold the two side corners inwards so it looks like an envelope.</p> 
        
       <p>Dip your finger into the prepared water and wet the top corner. Roll the egg roll from the filling side upwards. Place the egg roll on the prepared tray seam-side down.</p>
        
        Repeat with the remaining wrappers, lining up the egg rolls on the tray in a single layer.
    <li>Heat frying oil:</li>
       <p>Set a wire rack over a baking sheet. You will be placing the fried egg rolls on the rack. This allows the egg rolls to cool without steaming and getting soggy.</p>
        
       <p>In a medium pot, add enough oil to come about 2 inches up the sides of the pot. Heat the oil until a deep-fry thermometer registers 325°F. If you don’t have a deep-fry thermometer, you can test the temperature.</p> 
       <li>Fry the egg rolls:</li>
       <p>To test the oil temperature, carefully place one or two egg rolls into the oil. The oil should bubble up around the egg rolls. If it doesn’t, increase the heat. Fry for about 5 minutes until golden brown. Keep them moving in the oil using long wooden chopsticks or tongs to make sure they fry evenly.</p>
        
       <p>Transfer the fried egg roll onto the prepared rack to drain, leaving space between each so that they don’t steam and become soggy.</p> 
        
       <p>Repeat with the rest of the egg rolls, frying about 5 or so at a time, depending on the size of your pot. You want enough space between each egg roll for them to float around freely without touching each other for even cooking.</p>
       <li>Serve:</li>
       <p>Serve the egg rolls warm, but not burn-your-mouth hot, with a side of Chinese hot mustard, duck sauce, or chili sauce.</p>
